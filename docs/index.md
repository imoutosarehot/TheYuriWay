# The Yuri Way

If you are looking to learn Japanese, you have come to the right place.

If you are brand new to language learning, read the [30 Day Guide](30_Day_Guide.md), [FAQ](FAQ.md), and [Learn Japanese With Yuri](Learn_Japanese_With_Yuri.md). Then read the rest of the website. 

If you are not a beginner, consider reading the many guides and articles I have written:

- [The Yuri Method](The_Yuri_Method.md)
- [Resources](Resources.md)
- [Finding Yuri](Finding_Yuri.md)
- [Why You Should Do 100 New Cards Per Day](Why_You_Should_Do_100_New_Cards_Per_Day.md)

This website will continue to be updated with new articles and changes to the method, and new ideas emerge.
