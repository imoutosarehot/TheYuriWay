Welcome to the Yuri Way.

The Yuri Way is a guide for people learning to with Japanese through Yuri.

If you are not already familiar with input based language learning, I suggest reading [[!!!!!!!!THIS!!!!!!!!]] site for a good overview. Otherwise, this guide will outline my personal approaches to several different components of language learning with an assumption of baseline understanding. 

Many of my specific recommendations will be with mental illness in mind, and people who struggle with motivation, impulsivity, etc. may benefit. People looking for a more flexible or loose approach may also find some ideas useful.

If you are dedicated to Yuri or have questions, feel free to join the [[!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Discord Server!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]]

The following guides are all based on the same simple input based method, but take different approaches. They are not required reading but may be helpful if you feel lost, or that the Yuri Way is not well tailored to you. I do not necessarily endorse all recommendations made on the following.
