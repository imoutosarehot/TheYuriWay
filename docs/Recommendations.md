### Listening Recommendations

Listening content for Yuri is mostly limited to anime and a few j-drama. For beginners, most anime should be fine. I recommend:

- [ユリ熊嵐](https://anilist.co/anime/20827/)
- [フリップフラッパーズ](https://anilist.co/anime/21714/)
- [魔法少女まどか☆マギカ](https://anilist.co/anime/9756/)
- [やがて君になる](https://anilist.co/anime/101573/)
- [ゆるゆり](https://anilist.co/anime/10495/)
- [安達としまむら](https://anilist.co/anime/109287/)
- [citrus](https://anilist.co/anime/97832/citrus/)
- [ハッピーシュガーライフ](https://anilist.co/anime/101351/) personal favourite
 
Slightly harder options are: 

- [少女革命ウテナ](https://anilist.co/anime/440/)
- [マリア様がみてる](https://anilist.co/anime/158/)
- [ストロベリー・パニック](https://anilist.co/anime/855/)

Drama are also good but well out of my expertise. They will usually be harder than anime but not by much.

You can also find plenty of Yuri ASMR on [asmr.one](https://asmr.one/works?keyword=%24tag%3ALesbian%24) as well as a handful of audiobooks, including 安達としまむら.

### Reading Recommendations

The general pipeline for reading will be light novels/visual novels and then normal novels. Basically all Yuri light novels and visual novels are very beginner friendly, and normal novels aren't significantly harder. There are thousands of options here so I will try to list my favorites as well as popular/significant ones.

For beginners:

- [週に一度クラスメイトを買う話](https://bookmeter.com/books/20580019) ln, perfect beginner novel
- [女同士とかありえないでしょ](https://bookmeter.com/books/14915752) ln
- [安達としまむら](https://bookmeter.com/books/6508788) ln, very popular but kind of boring in my opinion
- [わたしが恋人になれるわけないじゃん、ムリムリ!](https://bookmeter.com/books/15079821) ln
- [屋上の百合霊さん](https://vndb.org/v8508) vn, really cute
- [はなひらっ！](https://vndb.org/v5244) vn, probably the easiest option on this list by far
- [FLOWERS](https://vndb.org/v14267) vn, haven't played this but it's quite popular

Slightly harder:

- [私の推しは悪役令嬢](https://lilydb.app/ja/info/3441fb98-658c-4e1b-9fe8-7bcb136c1774) ln, fantasy
- [転生王女と天才令嬢の魔法革命](https://lilydb.app/ja/info/e57dd897-5e55-4c56-98dc-f38c5f35d022) ln, fantasy
- [ツインスター・サイクロン・ランナウェイ](https://lilydb.app/ja/info/2c0bc7ef-8656-4ffe-ab2d-699dd2092b0a)ln, scifi
- [そいねドリーマー](https://bookmeter.com/books/17264694) novel
- [生のみ生のままで](https://bookmeter.com/books/19812437) novel from an award winning author
- [雨の塔](https://bookmeter.com/books/2344873) novel, personal favorite author of mine who has a lot of darker works
- [ユリ熊嵐](https://bookmeter.com/books/9213679) ln, another favorite
- [エヴァーメイデン](https://vndb.org/v31427) vn, very unique art and by an author I really like

Hard: 
- [花物語](https://bookmeter.com/books/529797) short stories, one of the progenitors to Yuri as a genre 
- [屋根裏の二処女](https://bookmeter.com/books/424639) novel, by the same author, argued to be the first actual Yuri
- [乙女の港](https://bookmeter.com/books/4269513) novel, another early Yuri by a famous author

Manga are annoying for language learning in my opinion, and are also rather annoying to find in Japanese. Most of them should be pretty easy though, and there are a LOT of really good works to read. Once I read more of them I will add a manga recommendation section.
