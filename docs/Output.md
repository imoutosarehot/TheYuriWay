### Early Output

I started outputting before I knew early output was supposed to be bad and turned out more or less fine. There are plenty of examples of people who have started output very early and still reached very high levels of proficiency. From personal observations, early outputters tend to be better and output than late outputters; however, this could be a motivation thing as early outputters are more likely to be people who enjoy output.

### Starting Output

If you are starting output, it will probably be hard at first - especially if you also struggle with listening. 

I personally recommend [VR Chat](VRChat.md) one-on-one conversation rooms for starting output, as most people there are friendly and it is easier than talking in a group. You can also find native speakers on several other platforms I will outline at the end of the article. If you know Japanese people in real life, they may also be a good option. If you are less social, outputting over text could also be a good option.

Output with other learners or in learning focused spaces is mostly a waste of time in my opinion, though it's probably not harmful so long as you are immersing a lot.

Remember to output for the sake of communication, not for the sake of getting better at output. 

### Pronunciation and Pitch

The only thing you need to get good pronunciation and pitch accent is a lot of listening immersion and a lot of time spent outputting. You can find plenty of examples of people with very good pronunciation and pitch who have not done anything else. However, there are some exercises that may still be useful.

All learners, regardless of level but especially beginners, should practice [Kotu](https://kotu.io/) minimal pairs to build a basic perception of pitch accent. 

Learning the rules associated with pitch from sources such as [Dogen](https://mega.nz/folder/sVEizTTb#Z_0QKuN2GyMphaK9w4-A5Q). (more sources will be listed later) could be helpful alongside immersion. 

Chorusing is better than shadowing in every way, but is still not essential in my opinion. Some people do seem to find it very helpful. Outputting may also feel more comfortable if you can use chorusing to sound decent before starting, but by no means is it necessary.

Pitch corrected roudoku is allegedly good for correcting individual pitch mistakes.

The whole idea of a language parent is kind of stupid, but choosing a dialect to speak in (hyoujungo for most people) is probably a good idea.

### Useful Tips

Immersing in topics that you tend to talk about a lot is a good idea.

Unless you are already cracked at output, stop trying to cosplay as Japanese and ask questions about things you don't understand. 

The next steps up from 日本語上手 are:
- question about your nationality (at least they are talking to you)
- 韓国人ですか (good pronunciation)
- 日本人ですか (they already know you aren't but are being careful)

Don't be introverted

### Good Places To Output

[VR Chat](https://hello.vrchat.com/)
- This is by far the best place to practice output short of meeting people in real life

[KoeTomo](https://koetomo.fun/)
- 誰とでも楽しく話せる！

I would love to list more options but these two have already been more than enough...
