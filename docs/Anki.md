### Settings

My settings are mostly normal, but I will go over the few unique ones.

I set new cards to 9999 per day and either:

a) learn all new cards I mine at the end of a given day
b) learn new cards as I immerse (see article on [Wikipedia](Wikipedia.md))
c) set a temporary limit on new cards if I am too tired to do them all

IMO this is a good approach because you learn words with the context fresh in your head, and while you are still immersing in the relevant content (e.g. you don't need to wait a month to see a card you mined). If you are a beginner, this may be too much, but you can give it a try if you want.

My learning steps are set to 1m 10m for new and 10m for lapses. I'm not sure if this is optimal for retention but it makes Anki very fast and I still almost always get between 85% and 95% true retention.

I also have leeches set to suspend for no particular reason.

### Mining 

Assuming that you are immersing for several hours per day, with some portion of that being reading, I think that you should only mine words with:

a) a kanji you have never seen
b) a new reading
c) words that you specifically want to remember

Words with characters and readings you already know are fairly easy to pick up via immersion. There may be benefits to mining words more generously, but I cannot speak to them given my limited experience.

Attaching images manually to some words may be beneficial.

Making a mining deck before you are finished [Kaishi](https://github.com/donkuri/Kaishi) is probably just a waste of time.

### Reviewing

I grade mostly based on reading, but also factor in (rough) meaning and pitch. Anki is probably not the best tool for learning meanings anyways, so I would not focus on them as much. Your energy is better used immersing more.

Pitch is basically part of the reading, and while I wouldn't do Anki *for* pitch it seems silly not to correct yourself while a specific word is still fresh. I only ignore pitch when I'm tired and just want to finish reviews quickly.

Streaks may me motivating for some learners, but there is no real benefit to adhering to them. You should try to do Anki as many days as you can. Taking breaks is fine. You can temporarily stop doing new cards if you do not have the energy. You also do not have to do all of your reviews; its completely fine to do half of them and then give up.

While doing new cards there also may be specific words that stick out as being harder to learn than others. You can literally just bury these and learn them another day if you want. 

### Premade Decks

There are several premade decks worth considering:

[Kaishi](https://github.com/donkuri/Kaishi)
Do this deck if you are new.

[Kanken Deck](https://animecards.site/writingjapanese/)
Do this deck once you know how to read and feel like learning how to write.

[Grammar Deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tDBaabwgZMO8nxkcwcw4qBXayuk_513T/view?usp=sharing)
Do this deck at some point if you want to learn JLPT grammar points.
